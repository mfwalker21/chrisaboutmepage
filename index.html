<div class="aboutparagraph">
<p>Chris, a proud Bronx native, finds inspiration in the rich cultural history of his hometown and known for its amazing food and vibrant Black-owned businesses. Passionate about coding, Chris enjoys creating web designs that blend minimalist and bold aesthetics. With a background in computer science and creative nonfiction writing, Chris aspires to pursue a career in interactive web design, UX/UI, and psychology to study the user interactions. When not coding or designing, Chris enjoys spending time with family, video games, anime (especially anime games), and drawing, while dreaming of future travels to Dubai, Japan, and Canada â€” though LA's sunsets and warm weather remain a favorite. Favorite colors are greens like jade and emerald, as well as most pastel tones.</p>
